## 🔧 Pre-deployment Validation

### Critical Path Testing
```bash
# 1. System requirements check
node --version        # >= 18.0.0
pnpm --version       # >= 8.0.0
git --version        # >= 2.40.0

# 2. Dependencies installation
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile

# 3. Test suite execution
pnpm run test:all

# 4. Production build
pnpm run build

# 5. Health checks
node packages/web/src/utils/healthCheck.js

# 6. Performance validation
node scripts/performance-baseline.js
```

### Environment Validation
```bash
# Required environment variables
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
echo $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY
echo $SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
echo $NODE_ENV

# Database connectivity
curl -I $NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL

# Service health
curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
curl http://localhost:4001/health
```

---

## 🚀 Deployment Execution

### Deployment Commands
```bash
# Standard production deployment
node scripts/advanced-deploy.js deploy

# Canary deployment (10% traffic)
node scripts/advanced-deploy.js deploy --canary
