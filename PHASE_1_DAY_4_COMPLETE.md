## 🔧 Technical Implementations

### 1. Test Configuration Standardization
```typescript
// Unified vitest.config.ts pattern
export default defineConfig({
  test: {
    environment: 'happy-dom',
    coverage: {
      provider: 'v8',
      reporter: ['text', 'html', 'json', 'lcov'],
      thresholds: {
        global: {
          branches: 80,
          functions: 80,
          lines: 80,
          statements: 80
        }
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### 2. Browser API Compatibility Solutions
- **Navigator API**: Implemented connection mock with event handling
- **Storage APIs**: Created localStorage/sessionStorage mocks
- **Performance API**: Provided comprehensive performance.now() and memory mocks
- **URL API**: Added createObjectURL/revokeObjectURL mocking
